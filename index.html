    <h1>Hello CodeWorks</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Colby DeRango</strong></p>
    <p>I am 25 years old from Driggs, Idaho. I spend my free time hiking, snowboarding and going to concerts.</p>
    <p>I have been working construction for the past 7 years and have really loved creating and building things from scratch.</p>
    <p>I decided to look for other avenues to continue to create and develop a life long career.</p>
    <p>I was researching enrolling into a Computer Science degree when I stumbled upon Boise CodeWorks.</p>
    <p>It seemed like great alternative considering time and money, and I am loving it so far!</p>
